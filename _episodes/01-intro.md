## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

And IDE is a piece of software that provides a set of tools to facilitate the development
of code. These tools usually include a powerful code editor, a debugger, a profiler and others.
These tools are very useful during the development of code, specially in large projects, and while
they are usually available independently, the IDE integrate them in a single software for more convenience.
